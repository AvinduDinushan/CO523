1. Show the evaluation of the expression is_even 3, given the following definitions

	let rec is_even n =
	    if n=0 then true
	    else is_odd (n-1)
	and is_odd n =
	    if n= 0 then false
	    else is_even (n-1)

  A classroom is identified by an integer grade and letter section such as 2A, 5B, 	  6F, ...
